[x] Science! - A Science Report and Checklist for Kerbal Space Program

[x] Science! keeps track of the science experiments you have completed and recovered to Kerbal Space

Center. It also tracks science you have gathered which is held on vehicles and kerbals.

No matter what game scene you are in, what you current vehicle is, [x] Science! always reports on all science held anywhere.

Now with in-flight status window.  No more searching around in service bays - run experiments at the click of a button.

Why use [x] Science! ?

In flight status window kind of like Science Alert
With a simple list and a textbox filter it is really easy to use.
Available from anywhere. No need to leave your craft and switch to the KSC Lab.
It reports on all science, not just the stuff you have recovered to KSC.
It reports on all vehicles, great for multi-craft missions. (Option to check debris for science.)
Report on anywhere from anywhere else. Where should you go next?
Wondering what to do next? Give your Kerbals a purpose.
