		Fixed 'Here and Now' window not resizing correctly when hiding MinScience slider.
		Fixed position of experiment buttons in 'Here and Now' window when MinScience slider hidden.
		Fixed experiments not being re-classified as incomplete (or completed) when switching between regular and VeryLowMinScience if MinScience slider hidden.

		A new setting: "Simple Mode" that simply hides the bottom number on the experiment buttons and slightly increases the font size, for a cleaner look.
